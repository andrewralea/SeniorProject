# Senior Project (RF Non-Linear Signal Component Analyzer)
#### Michael Ralea and Krupa Tishbi

This project aims to apply software-defined-radio to nonlinear signal component analysis. Specifically, to tap signals before and after passing through an amplifier, and processing the different signals via comparison to calculate / measure amplifier parameters such as third order intercept.

The software defined radio dongle in use is the RTL-SDR v3: https://www.rtl-sdr.com/rtl-sdr-blog-v-3-dongles-user-guide/
